# SIF3012-Computing-Assignment
The project is dedicated for computing assignment of SIF3012 which is titled "Simulation of Chaotic Behaviour of Atmospheric Circulation Using Lorenz Model with Runge-Kutta 4th-Order"

This project contains two Google Collab files, with file names and purposes listed below:
1) SIF3012_New_Lorenz.ipynb: 
This code shows an introduction to solving Lorenz System using numerical method, before going into chaotic behavior.
