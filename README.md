# SIF3012-Computing-Assignment
The project is dedicated for computing assignment of SIF3012 which is titled "Simulation of Chaotic Behaviour of Atmospheric Circulation Using Lorenz Model with Runge-Kutta 4th-Order"


Lorenz System : The code is a showcase of chaotic nature of the Lorenz system where changes of parametric value and initial conditions will lead to different results.
By the way, I had a bit issue with the graph display as it looks kind of ugly, and not really viewer friendly, do help me do some modification if possible. Thanks!
