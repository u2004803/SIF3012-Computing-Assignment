# SIF3012-Computing-Assignment
The project is dedicated for computing assignment of SIF3012 which is titled "Simulation of Chaotic Behaviour of Atmospheric Circulation Using Lorenz Model with Runge-Kutta 4th-Order"


Lorenz System : The code is more or less completed, maybe can work on manipulation of initial coordinates with fixed parameter values (sigma, beta, rho) and check if there is any significant shape/pattern existed (2 circles)

Chaotic Behaviour : I have also completed the code with only changing the timestep and F value for the plot, now only need to work on the explanation. Precaution is the result here may vary from the paper since the paper used 6th order Runge Kutta while we used 4th order Runge-Kutta
